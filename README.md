## This is a text-based adventure game in Python, titled "Zombie Pets!"

This is one of my first Python projects! Titled "Zombie Pets", this is a text-based adventure game where you must save yourself from zomebies. But not just any zombies, PET ZOMBIES.

Play at your own risk. :)

Can you win? Most can't, you have a 1 in 12th chance of making it out alive. But what about the fate of your pets?
No worries, they won't die. They'll just get zombie-fied!

Download on any computer that can run Python and run from terminal or your preferred IDE.
